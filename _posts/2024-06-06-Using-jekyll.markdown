**Jekyll** was used to develop this site. 

This blog post is a markdown file similar to that used on GitHub repository ReadMe files.

You can find a Markdown Cheat Sheet at [this link](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
