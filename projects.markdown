4. **REST API Demonstration**

   This is a Spring Boot MVC application that implements the CRUD methods.
   It uses a MySQL Database.
   - You can test the CRUD method REST requests on POSTMAN or using *curl* commands.
   - There is also a Web View that implements the CRUD methods (using web forms and tables).
